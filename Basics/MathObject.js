/*Math is a built - in object that has properties and methods
for mathematical constants and functions.It’ s not a
function object.



Description
Unlike many other global objects, Math is not a 
constructor. All properties and methods of Math are 
static. You refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and 
you call the sine function as Math.sin(x), 
where x is the method’s argument. 
Constants are defined with the full precision of 
real numbers in JavaScript.*/

console.log('pi value is :' + Math.PI);
console.log('Max number of 23, 54, 87 is :' + Math.max(23, 54, 87));
console.log('Min number of 23, 54, 87 is :' + Math.min(23, 54, 87));
console.log('10 Power of 3 is :' + Math.pow(10, 3));
console.log('sin(45) is :' + Math.sin(45));
